The ceiling is a cathedral vaulted (multi-domed) and with the tattered remains of what once must have been colorful streamers hanging down. A corpse covered in webs lay against the north wall right next to the entrance of what appears to be a kitchen. To the east lies a long dark hall and the west another. The room smells of mildew and decay."

You stretch your eyes as wide as possible but can barely make out a feeble outline of some distant objects. There is little light except for the for a small strip below the door at the top of the stairs and a small torch which illuminates only what is in its immediate vicinity."
